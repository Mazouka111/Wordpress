The book is also sought by the evil scientist Skagra, who has developed a sphere capable of drawing its victims'' minds out of their bodies.

Long ago they imprisoned the criminal Salyavin there, as punishment for using his powers to transfer his mind into other people''s bodies.

However, when the Doctor pretends to be stupid, the sphere fails to drain his mind completely. He thus survives, and since there''s a copy of his mind inside the sphere, he is able to use the resonance to turn Skagra''s possessed slaves against him.
